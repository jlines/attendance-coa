This NodeJS script will read attendance data from a CSV file and generate curl commands which will submit the attendance data to the COA attendance form. There are fields in the run.js file that need to be updated to reflect your personal account on the website. times.csv is a sample csv file containing the attendance data.

This script requires NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/) and Curl (https://curl.se/)
